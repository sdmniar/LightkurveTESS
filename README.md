# LightkurveTESS

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook created for a coding workshop hosted on behalf of the UBC Astronomy Club.

**Purpose**: Explore and analyze light curves from TESS using the `Lightkurve` Python package, a user-friendly tool widely used in exoplanet research.

**Contents**:
1. A self-paced notebook introducing the basics of exoplanets and current methods for their detection.
2. Download and work with data for a chosen TIC ID.
3. Resample light curve data to reduce noise.
4. Generate power spectra to identify significant periodic signals.
5. Perform phase folding to visualize repeated patterns.
6. Compare light curves to background flux to detect potential false positives.
7. Analyze light curves to estimate planetary characteristics.
